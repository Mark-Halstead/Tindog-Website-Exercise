#Tindog Website

- Learnt how to use the bootstrap 5 framework for CSS
- Learnt how to effectively use the bootstrap dev docs and how to use other websites like Stack overflow and W3 schools to learn more about certain code implementations and also start to learn how to solve certain issues on my own such as how absolute positioning can effect other elements on the page.
